        My name is Dylan Littlewood i am a frontend developer from sheffield. I have a passion for programming and like
        to do this in my own time even though it has nothing to do with my current job role as a senior production
        technician. As well as programming i also like to climb in my spare time, i frequently go to a climbing gym in
        Sheffield and also go out hiking round the peak district when i get the chance.
